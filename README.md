# Environment-and-Resource-Templates
Set of boilerplate tools for quicker dev environment setup

1. Asset Compilation Template: Contains an npm setup for a gulp task manager which manages the following: 
	- The compilation of sass to css
	- minification of sass and js
	- uglification of js
	- compression of images 

2. React Dev Environment Template: Contains an npm setup for a webpack compiler.
	- When you pull this down, you will need to run an npm install
	- To compile your jsx, type webpack into command line
	- If you would like to run your app on a local node server, run webpack-dev-server. This will initialize and compile your jsx, and continue to watch the files for changes, all while running your app on a local server.
