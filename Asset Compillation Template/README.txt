# Before you can use the gulp asset compiler, 
# you must have the following installed: Node.js
# You can confirm this by typing 'node -v' into a cmd or terminal

# Setup: 
# Copy the files from 'Asset Compillation Template' into your project file
# Open a command line and cd to your project directory
# Type 'npm install'. This will install the node modules required for the gulpfile
# Open the gulpfile.js and replace the file paths with your own.
# If you need to exclude any tasks (i.e. you only want to compile sass or minify js)
# Find the corresponding task and comment it out in the watch and default task. 

# That's it! When you want to begin watching files, just type gulp into your command line.
# Please note that you must restart your watch if files are added. These files are only tracked
# If they exist in the src folder before gulp starts running.
